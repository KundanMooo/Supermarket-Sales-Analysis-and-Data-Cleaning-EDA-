# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis-and-Data-Cleaning-EDA-
An in-depth project involving data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to analyze supermarket sales trends,branch performance for actionable insights.
This project involves an in-depth analysis of supermarket sales data, including data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The data was initially reviewed to identify features and identify empty columns, which were then handled by replacing missing values. EDA was performed , including graphs for showcasing the variation of unit price and quantities, gender ratios of customers visiting the supermarket also shown correlation matrix. The project also includes an examination of the sales share across the three branches of the supermarket and their contribution to total sales. Univariate analysis was conducted on total sales, mean sale, mean rating, mean quantity, and insights were extracted based on different time periods such as months, hours, and quarters. This comprehensive project provides valuable insights into supermarket sales.


# Insights
### Improve product ratings: With the knowledge that missing ratings were replaced with the
mean rating, the supermarket can focus on improving the quality and customer happiness of
items with lower ratings in order to better the overall shopping experience for customers.
### Modify pricing strategies: By evaluating the variation in unit prices and quantities, the supermarket
may spot patterns in pricing and make necessary price adjustments. Reevaluating
pricing tactics for particular products, for instance, may be advantageous if their prices vary
widely.
### Boost marketing efforts: Bar graphs showing gender distribution can be utilised for more
accurate marketing activities. In order to increase consumer engagement and sales, the supermarket
can customise promotional events, product displays, and adverts to individual
gender preferences.
### The supermarket can pinpoint failing locations and take action to improve inventory levels,
product selection, and operational efficiency in those regions through analysing sales distribution
across different stores and cities.
### Optimising product line offerings: Supermarkets may determine the best-performing product
categories and make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies,
and possible growth of profitable product lines via the insights gained from analysing the
total sales, mean sales, mean rating, and total quantity across different product lines.
### Determine peak sales times: The supermarket can identify periods of highest sales and make
suitable preparations by using the data gathered from the date column, such as month, year,
days, weekend, and quarter. To maximise sales at times of high demand, this could involve
altering employee numbers, inventory restocking, and promotional efforts.
## Based on the data that was gathered, these choices might result in greater
customer happiness, more sales, improved management of inventory, and overall
company success for the supermarket
